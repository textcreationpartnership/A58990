         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Favourable Entertainment which the Firſt Part of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports met with at your Hands, hath encouraged me to Preſent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of them to Your peruſal: The acceptance whereof I ſhall not much doubt, when I conſider that beſides the Charm of Novelty, the Caſes were heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed with great Deliberation and Solemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in our own times, by Perſons very Eminent and Famous in their Profeſſions, and upon that account they bear with them their own Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For I cannot imagin, that the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> Cauſes, which, if of any conſiderable weight (as uſually they are) being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb facs="tcp:33203:3"/>mixt with Law, ſhould receive a cloſer and more ſatisfactory Determination, when they are Pronounced from a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yg man or a bare Stateſ-man, than from one of that Honourable Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>To render them the more intire, I have abridged the great Caſe of the <hi>Duke of Norfolk,</hi> which hath ſolidly ſetled, the perplexed Points of Perpetuities: It is true, The Lord Chanceller <hi>Finch</hi> differed in Opinion at that time from the Learned Judges, and he was in pain to do it; yet certainly there is no Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, (let him Eſpouſe his Notions never ſo dearly) but muſt both admire and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Equity of that Caſe.</p>
            <p>I have added an Abſtract of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Caſe of <hi>Com' Mountague</hi> contra <hi>Com' de Bath,</hi> with the Judges and Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's concurrent Opinions, and their Reaſons briefly recited; but that Cauſe by Appeal now depending before the Higheſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature in the Nation, and waiting the Deciſion of the Honourable Houſe of Peers, I do not think fit to mentiom more of it.</p>
            <p>In many other excellent and uſeful Caſes here Reported, tho' they have been Argued and decreed in a Court of Equity, yet a Common Lawyer may find many Points agreed and ſetled to good ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reſpecting thoſe two great Cargoes
<pb facs="tcp:33203:3"/>of Law-buſineſs, WILLS and SET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMENTS.</p>
            <p>But Laſtly, to obviate an Objection which cauſeth ſome quarrel with us; How comes it to paſs, that after ſuch frequent and ſolemn arguing of Cauſes, in all their Niceties and Circumſtantials, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are ſo often Reverſt by ſucceeding Chancellors? I muſt Reply to this, as that Learned Chancellor did in the above mentioned Caſe of the <hi>Duke of Norfolk. I muſt be ſaved by my own Faith, and muſt not Decree againſt my own Conſcience and Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides by a further Penetration into the Series of Tranſactions, the Intentions of the Parties and the like, perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may ariſe which was not thought of, or not thoroughly conſidered. But the true and main Cauſe of the variety of our Opinions is, the Natural Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Faculties: Uncertainty even in our own Judgments, is incident to our Nature. And I cannot expreſs my Notion better, than in the bold Words of that Ingenious Canoniſt <hi>Gomez, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula de Triennali poſſeſſore,</hi> cap. 5. <hi>Non eſt inconveniens judicium eſſe uno tempore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum &amp; poſtea ejus contrarium juſtius. Et hoc malum imponi videtur mortalibus in poenam, ut eorum Opiniones ſecundum varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem temporum ſeneſcant &amp; intermoriantur.

               <p>The Defendants ſay, That <hi>William</hi> the Grandfather died in the life time of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Grandſon, and that the perſonal Eſtate of <hi>William</hi> the Grandfather came to 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and that <hi>William Every</hi> the Grandſon was Buried 23 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1660, and was about 20 years old when he was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and <hi>Suſan,</hi> the Plaintiffs Daughter, was Buried 25 <hi>July</hi> 1655, and was about 18 years old when ſhe was Buried; and <hi>Martha</hi> the Plaintiffs Daughter was Buried 4 <hi>July</hi> 1660, and was about 20 years old when ſhe was Buried; and it appears there was ſufficient Perſonal Eſtate to ſatisfie the ſeveral Portions demanded.</p>
               <p>Which Caſe the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls</hi> having conſidered, and upon the Hearing before him, Declared, That he was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the 1500 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, by the Deed and Will aforeſaid, for Portions to <hi>Suſan</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> Daughters of the Plaintiff, was a Debt or Duty well fixed in them by the ſaid Deeds and Will, and by their Deaths did accrue and belong to the Plaintiff their Mother, as Adminiſtratrix to them, did Decree the ſame ſhould be paid according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

By which Deed the Survivorſhip between the two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is barred, and a proviſion made, That <hi>if either of them die in the life time of</hi> William <hi>the Grandſon, the Portion of her ſo dying ſhall not go to her Executors, but to the Grandſon.</hi> And <hi>William</hi> the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, having by his Will of the 9th of <hi>March,</hi> 1651. wherein he recites the Deed of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1651. limited and appointed 900 <hi>l.</hi> apiece to be paid to his Daughters ſeverally out of his perſonal Eſtate, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raiſing their Portions to 1500 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, having (as is recited) made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by his Deed dated the laſt of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1651, for advancing their Portions to that Value. And he doth by his Will declare and appoint, that ſuch Portions

               <p>His Lordſhip and the Judges were all clear of Opinion, there was no ground for the former Decree made by the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> or pretence of Claim to either of the ſaid Portions of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> by the Plaintiff, as Adminiſtratrix to <hi>Suſan</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> and diſcharged the Decreed and diſmiſt the Bill.</p>

               <p>The Bill is to be Relieved againſt the Forfeiture of the ſaid Eſtate, for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſaid Condition in the Will, and Marrying againſt the conſent of the Truſtees and the Mother: Yet the ſaid Mother was told, That the Plaintiff was about to marry, and ſaid nothing to the contrary; whereupon the Plaintiff mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and hath Iſſue.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff inſiſting, That if any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were committed in Marrying, it was through Ignorance, and not Obſtinacy, ſhe the Plaintiff being very young, and knew not of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> or Condition in the ſaid Will; and it would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to make the happineſs of the Plaintiff to depend upon the conſent of Strangers in point of Marriage, to put it into their power to keep her during her life, either from Marrying, or from her Eſtate, and thereby make them Maſters of her Affection or Fortune, and to diſinherit her and her Children.</p>
               <p>But the Defendant inſiſts, That the Reaſon of inſerting the ſaid <hi>Proviſo</hi> into the ſaid Will was, that the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> might be diſpoſed of in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

               <p>This Court, with the Judges and on peruſal of Preſidents, are clear of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fully ſatisfied, That the Plaintiff ought not to be relieved againſt the ſaid Forfeiture, and that the ſame was ſuch

               <p>The Defendants inſiſt, That the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> paid 1750 <hi>l.</hi> and 80 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> during the Minority of the Children, which is more than the Value, ſo look'd on her ſelf an abſolute Owner, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the ſaid Leaſe, whereof the ſaid

                  <hi>Robert</hi> had a Moiety,<note place="margin">Leaſe to commence after failure of payment.</note> and that this differs from ordinary Mortgages, the Leaſe being to commence after failure of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Heirs, Executors or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators of the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> and there was no <hi>Proviſo</hi> therein, and that the ſaid Lady <hi>Ann</hi> in all probability hath paid many Hundreds of Pounds, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might have lived many years longer; and tho' the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> had paid treble the value, yet ſhe muſt have been contented with her Security, and the ſaid <hi>Robert Brett</hi> did not think the ſame worth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming; and tho' the Reverſion in Fee was Extended in 1646; yet the ſaid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Brett</hi> and the Defendant <hi>Ewens</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued poſſeſſion till Judgment on the Writ of Partition, and from thence till 1662. which was 20 years after the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Judgment, and the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> was to continue poſſeſſion till the Children at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 21 years of Age, which was in 1636. when the ſaid demiſe to them made did commence.</p>
               <p>This Court being aſſiſted with the Judges, were of Opinion and declared themſelves fully ſatisfied, That the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ought not to have any Relief againſt the Defendants, but that the Bill ought to be diſmiſſed, for that his Lordſhip doth take a difference betwixt the Leaſe which is to commence after failure of Payment,

               <p>The Defendants inſiſt, That by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>London,</hi> a Declaration to let in a Child for a Cuſtomary part, ought to be by the Teſtators laſt Will, or by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writing under Hand, remaining in force, and unrevoked, and that it ought to be an expreſs Declaration, which the

               </p>
               <p>That in 1671, the ſaid <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi> Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, whoſe Heir the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Bruce</hi> is, and after the Lord <hi>John Seymour</hi> became Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33203:111"/>died without Iſſue, by whoſe death the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Bruce</hi> is intituled as Heir to Duke <hi>William</hi> her Grandfather, to the reverſion in fee of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> Duke <hi>John</hi> being only Tenant in Tail thereof, and ought to injoy the ſame, it not being liable to pay any debts, but is diſcharged thereof by her Grandfathers Will, and not diſpoſed from her by any Act, the 19100 <hi>l.</hi> being all paid.</p>
               <p>So that the queſtions now before the Court were, whether the reverſion of <hi>Mudghill</hi> expectant upon <hi>Pleydalls</hi> Eſtate for life, as well as the reſidue of the Eſtate be liable to all the debts, which Duke <hi>William</hi> owed at his death, or only to the 19100 <hi>l.</hi> debts.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, Whether the reverſion of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> as well as the reſidue of the Eſtate, after ſatisfaction of all the debts of Duke <hi>William,</hi> ought to be for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all Duke <hi>Williams</hi> Daughters, and the Plaintiff Lady <hi>Bruce</hi> and their Heirs equally, or the ſaid reverſion to go intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſaid Lady <hi>Bruce,</hi> as right Heir to Duke <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt queſtion, the Defendant inſiſted the ſaid Reverſion, as well as the other Eſtate is liable to all the debts, for that by the deed of 1652. <hi>Mudghill</hi> was conveyed for raiſing of Money for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 19100 <hi>l.</hi> debts, and all other debts that he ſhould owe at the time of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33203:112"/>his death, in which deed it is provided, that after the ſaid debts be paid, he might by any deed, or his laſt Will, Revoke all or any of the ſaid Truſts, other than as concerning the 19100. debts, yet made no Revocation, other than by his laſt Will, and therein he Revoked, only thoſe Truſts that were for the benefit of the Lord <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> or the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> or his own right Heirs, and by the ſaid deed, the Legal Eſtate in <hi>Mudghill,</hi> is ſetled in the Truſtees and their Heirs, and the Duke had no power to Revoke the uſes or Eſtates, till after the 19100 <hi>l.</hi> was paid, and the ſaid Duke directing his Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees to convey <hi>Mudghill</hi> to his Son <hi>John,</hi> he did thereby diſpoſe of an equitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, only of the reverſion of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> and the 19100 <hi>l.</hi> was not paid in the ſaid Dukes life-time, but great part remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, and he hath contracted ſeveral new debts, ſince the 20th of <hi>April</hi> 1654. which the Defendant ſince paid upon the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſaid Lands, and <hi>Mudghill</hi> is one of the Mannours conveyed by the deed of 1652. for the payment of 19100 <hi>l.</hi> and all other the debts he ſhould owe at the time of his death; and altho' the ſame be directed by the laſt Will of the ſaid Duke, to be ſetled upon the Lord <hi>John Seymour,</hi> and his Heirs Males, yet the ſaid Duke by deed of 1652. had no power to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33203:112"/>revoke the ſame for the payment of his debts, or if he had, he did not revoke the ſame by the ſaid Will; but left <hi>Mudghill</hi> and other the premiſſes ſubject to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his debts; and the Truſtees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſuch to be the Dukes intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never ſetled <hi>Mudghill</hi> on the ſaid Lord <hi>John Seymour,</hi> who being lately dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, the ſame is ſubjected to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Duke <hi>Williams</hi> debts, and when debts are ſatisfied, the overplus of the Moneys, and the ſaid <hi>Mudghill,</hi> and all other the premiſſes ought to be divided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent of the ſaid Dukes Will, and by the ſaid Dukes death, and the Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſaid Truſtees, the intereſt in Law became veſted in Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgman,</hi> and he conveyed <hi>Mudghill, &amp;c.</hi> unto the ſaid Dutcheſs, and the ſaid <hi>Gape</hi> and other the Truſtees and their Heirs, that they might therewith pay the ſaid debts; and though there be ſufficient beſides <hi>Mudghill</hi> to pay all the debts, yet by the Will upon which this queſtion doth ariſe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Truſt for the Right Heirs of the ſaid Duke, are revoked in expreſs Terms, ſo that by any deed preceding the ſaid Will, the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Bruce</hi> cannot claim any advantage as Heir, the rather, for that by the Will it doth appear, that Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had an equal regard to his own Daughter, and the Plaintiff the Lady
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33203:113"/>
                  <hi>Bruce</hi> his Grandchild and Heir, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſumed, that he would more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf for the Welfare of a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, than his own Daughters, nor was the ſaid Reverſion of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> diſpoſed to the Plaintiff by any words in the Will, though he did by expreſs words in his Will, Revoke all Truſts, for the benefit of his Heirs in <hi>Mudghill,</hi> as well as the other Lands, and made other particular proviſions further, which ſhews, he did not intend that for her, for if he had, he would not have Revoked the former Truſts, as to that by which ſhe would have been intituled as Heir, eſpecially, when he hath deviſed all the Surplus of his Eſtate, which involves <hi>Mudghill</hi> as well as the reſt, amongſt his own three Daughters, and her equally, nor doth it any where appear, that <hi>Mudghill</hi> is in any ſort exempted from Satisfaction of the Creditors, nor could it ſo be by the ſaid deed made by Sir <hi>Olando Bridgman,</hi> who beſt knew the intention of all Parties in this matter.</p>
               <p>But the Plaintiffs inſiſted, That the ſaid Duke could not intend <hi>Mudghill</hi> ſhould be conveyed to the uſes declared in the Will, for that the ſame is to be conveyed to the ſaid Lord <hi>John,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, which is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Inheritance, and he had power
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33203:113"/>by a common Recovery to have bound the remainder, and the reverſion after the Eſtate tale is not Aſſets in Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be conceived for the payment of his debts, and the rather, for that he recites deeds in 1652. and <hi>April</hi> 1654. and directs the Truſtees therein, to convey all his Lands and Mannours in thoſe deeds, to his Dutcheſs and others, as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> as before he declared by his Will; and as to all the reſt of the Mannours, he declared for the payment of his Debts, ſo that (all the reſt) excludes the Mannours of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> and upon the whole Will it doth appear, the Duke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no Reverſion ſhould paſs, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions after Eſtates for life or years, and therefore this Reverſion of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> which is after an Eſtate Tail, doth not paſs, and if it had been intended to paſs, he would have limited it to the ſaid Lord <hi>John</hi> for life, without remainder to his firſt or other Sons in Tail, for he had before given him a better Eſtate in <hi>Mudghill</hi> to him and the Heirs of his Body, and the Truſtees were not to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Mudghill</hi> accordingly, until the ſame fell in poſſeſſion, the ſame being yet for <hi>Pleydalls</hi> life.</p>
               <p>This Court on reading the ſeveral Deeds and Will, declared, That although the Lord <hi>John,</hi> might poſſibly have an Eſtate Tail in him, and doct it; but he not doing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:33203:114"/>it, this Court can take no notice of it, though probably he did forbear to do it, becauſe Duke <hi>William</hi> had Signified his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,<note place="margin">Reverſion after an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Tail ſubject to Truſts for payment of debts.</note> that he ſhould not have an Eſtate executed to him, till it ſhould fall in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and not before, except the Truſtees pleaſed: But the caſe muſt be taken, as it doth appear before the Court, that is, <hi>Mudghill</hi> was once liable to the payment of the Debts of Duke <hi>William,</hi> and tho' 'tis pretended that the Will hath taken out <hi>Mudghill,</hi> yet the ſaid Will doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take out an Eſtate Tail, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſion thereof, when the ſame falls in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, is ſubject to the ſame Truſt, and goes in company with the other Reverſions, and the ſame is legally conveyed, and doth paſs in the general words, and therefore this Court is of Opinion, that the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Mudghill,</hi> is part of the unrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Eſtate, and that the Lord <hi>Bridgman</hi> did well, when he made the ſaid Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Lady Dutcheſs, and that when the 19100. <hi>l.</hi> and the ſaid other debts are paid, to which <hi>Mudghill</hi> is as well liable, as the other Mannours and Lands, then the Truſtees ought to convey all the premiſſes in <hi>Fourths,</hi> and decreed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33203:125"/>Releaſe; and the Limitation of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, after the Term of 200 years, is firſt to <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, then to Mr. <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> the now Plaintiff (Brother of the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi>) and ſo to all his Brothers Succeſſively in Tail Male remainder over. Then by the ſaid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deed, the Earl declares the Truſt of the Term of 200 years, and that deed in the reciting part declares, that it was intended the ſaid Term ſhould attend the Inheritance and the profits ſhould go to ſuch perſons, and in ſuch manner as was therein after limited <hi>(viz.)</hi> to <hi>Henry Howard</hi> now Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, ſo long as Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> Lord <hi>Maltrevers</hi> Eldeſt Son of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Arundell</hi> or any Iſſue Male of his Body ſhould be living; but in caſe he ſhould die without Iſſue Male in the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> not leaving his Wife <hi>enſeint</hi> with a Son, or in caſe after the death of <hi>Thomas,</hi> without Iſſue Male, the Honour of the Earldom of <hi>Arundel</hi> ſhould deſcend to <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> then <hi>Henry Howard</hi> and his Heirs to be excluded of the Truſt, and then it ſhould be to (<hi>Charles</hi> the Plaintiff) and the Heirs Males of his Body, remainder in like manner to other Brothers. After this, the Contingency doth happen, for <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> dies
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33203:125"/>without Iſſue, and the Earldom of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> as well as the Dukedom of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> deſcended to <hi>Henry</hi> now Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> by <hi>Thomas</hi> his death without Iſſue, preſently upon this, the Marqueſs of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> the Surviving Truſtee, Aſſigns the Term to one <hi>Marriott,</hi> he Aſſigns it to the now Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Duke ſuffers a Recovery, to the uſe of him and his Heirs, and the Plaintiffs Bill is to have execution of the Truſt of this Term, to the uſe of himſelf and his Heirs Males of his Body.</p>
               <p>The Defendants inſiſt, That by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment by <hi>Marriott,</hi> to my Lord Duke <hi>Henry,</hi> the Term was Surrendred, and quite gone, that the Common Recovery which barred the remainders, which the other Brothers had, would alſo be a Bar to the Truſt of this Term, and that the truſt of a Term to <hi>Henry</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, until by the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> without Iſſue, the Earldom ſhould deſcend upon him, and after that, to <hi>Charles</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, was a void Limitation of the remainder to <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff inſiſts, Though the Term by the Survivor is gone, and Merged in the Inheritance, yet the Truſt of that Term remains in Equity; That this is not a Term that attends the Inheritance, but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33203:126"/>its a Term in groſs, and ſo not barred by the Recovery, and that the Limitation of the remainder in Contingency, is good in Law, and Relief ought to be had in this Court.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Nottingham</hi> (the Caſe being of great Conſequence) calls the Judges to his Aſſiſtance, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> and the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Mountague,</hi> and they made one ſingle point in the caſe.</p>
               <p>Whether this Contingent Truſt of a Term limited to the Plaintiff <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Heirs of his Body, upon the dying of <hi>Thomas</hi> without Iſſue Male, whereby the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did deſcend to <hi>Henry,</hi> be good in point of Creation and Limitation; for as for the Recovery, if this be not a good Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in point of Creation, the Recovery will do nothing, ſo that ſuppoſeth it to go along with the Inheritance, and if this take effect, then it will ſuffer no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice by the Recovery: And as for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment by <hi>Marriott</hi> to the Duke, if this Court decree it for the Plaintiff, then it is a Breach of Truſt, and then he muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it, and ſo muſt the Duke, for it is a Surrender to a perſon, who had notice of the Truſt: If for the Defendant, then it is of no weight. So that the whole reſts upon the firſt ſingle point <hi>(viz.)</hi> whether
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33203:126"/>it be a good Limitation upon the Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency to <hi>Charles,</hi> or as they call it,<note place="margin">Springing Truſt.</note> a ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truſt.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid three Judges were all of Opinion, that it was a void Limitation, and that it ought to be Decreed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>They ſaid,<note place="margin">Term in groſs, and a Term at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Inheritance the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</note> there is great difference as to the Limitation of Terms that are in groſs, and Terms that attend the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as to Terms in Groſs, they are not capable of Limitation to one, after the death of another, without Iſſue; but in Termsattendant upon an Inheritance, there may be ſuch a Limitation, if the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be ſo limited, and not elſe: Now the Term is capable of a Limitation to <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, and for want of ſuch Iſſue to <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body; becauſe it hath an Inheritance to ſupport it: But now to put another limitation upon it, that upon the dying of <hi>Thomas</hi> without Iſſue, whereby the Earldom ſhall deſcend, this ſhall go over to <hi>Charles,</hi> that cannot be, for it hath no Freehold to ſupport it, and ſo its a Term in groſs; further, there cannot by the Rules of Law or Equity, be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for years, of a Term limited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Eſtate Tail, neither directly, nor upon Contingency; as in <hi>Burges</hi>'s Caſe, but the Law will allow a remainder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33203:127"/>upon an Eſtate for life; ſo likewiſe upon a Contingency, if that were to happen during the Continuance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eſtate: But this caſe is a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to be allowed; they relied chiefly upon <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Bayles Caſe,</hi> which was put thus by Chief Baron <hi>Mountague,</hi> a Deviſe by <hi>A.</hi> of a Term to <hi>William</hi> his Eldeſt Son, and his Aſſigns, and if he die without Iſſue, then to <hi>Thomas</hi> his youngeſt Son. It was Judged in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Chamber,</hi> to be a void remainder, becauſe thereby a perpetuity would enſue, though it was argued in that caſe, that it was given upon a Contingency to the younger Son, which would ſoon be Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and end in a ſhort time. Chief Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Mountague</hi> put this for Law, a Term may be limited to one, and the Heirs Males of his Body, upon a Contingency to happen firſt with Limitation over, if that Contingency do not happen, it is a good Limitation, as if a Term be limited to the Wife for Life, and then to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, if he over-live his Mother, and the Heirs Males of his Body, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over to a younger Son, if the Eldeſt Son dye in the life of the Mother, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to the ſecond Son may be good, but if there be an Inſtant Eſtate Tail crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a Term, tho there be a Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as to the expectation of him in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33203:127"/>yet this is ſuch a Total Diſpoſition of a Term, as after which, no Limitation of a Term can be; and ſo the Judges were of Opinion, that the Plaintiff had no Right to the Term, but the decree ought to be for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Nottingham</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Judges, and Decreed for the Plaintiff. He put ſome ſteps or Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, which he agreed with them, and which were clear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Term in queſtion, though it were attendant on the Inheritance at firſt, yet upon the hapning of the Contingency, its become a Term in groſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Truſt of a Term in groſs, can be limited no otherwiſe in Equity, than the Eſtate of a Term in groſs can be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The legal Eſtate of a Term for years, whether it be a long or a ſhort Term, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be limited to any Man in Tail, with the remainder over to another after his death without Iſſue, this is a direct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If a Term be limited to a Man and his Iſſue, and if that Iſſue die without Iſſue, the remainder over, the Iſſue of that Iſſue takes no Eſtate, and yet becauſe the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over cannot take place till the Iſſue of that Iſſue fail, that remainder is void too. <hi>Reeves</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:33203:128"/>5. If a Term be limited to a Man for his life, and after to his Firſt, Second, and Third Son in Tail Succeſſively, and for default of ſuch Iſſue the remainder over, though the Contingency never happen, yet the remainder is void, though there were never a Son born to him; that looks like a perpetuity, Sir <hi>William Buckhurſts</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. One Caſe more, and that is <hi>Burgeſss</hi> Caſe; A Term is limited to one for life, with Contingent remainders to his Sons in Tail, with remainder over to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though he had no Son, yet becauſe it was foreign and diſtant, to expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder after the death of a Son, to be born without Iſſue, that having a proſpect of a perpetuity, was adjudged void.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If a Term be Deviſed, or Truſt of a Term limited to one for life, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remainders for life Succeſſively, and all the Perſons in <hi>Eſſe</hi> at the time of ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, theſe are all good remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A Term is Deviſed to one for 18. years, after to <hi>C.</hi> his Eldeſt Son for life, and then to the Eldeſt Iſſue Male of <hi>C.</hi> for life, though <hi>C.</hi> had not any Iſſue Male at the time of the Deviſe, or death of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor, but before the death of <hi>C.</hi> its good, being a Contingency that would ſpeedily be worn out. <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Heaths</hi> Caſe; for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33203:128"/>there may be a Poſſibility upon a Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a Contingency upon a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and in truth every Executory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe is ſo; and therefore the contrary Rule given by Lord <hi>Popham,</hi> in the <hi>Rector of Chedingtons</hi> Caſe, is not Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe things were agreed by all.</p>
               <p>But the Point is: The Truſt of a term for 200 years is limited to <hi>Henry</hi> in Tail, provided if <hi>Thomas</hi> die without Iſſue in the life of <hi>Henry,</hi> ſo that the Earldom ſhall deſcend upon <hi>Henry,</hi> then to go to <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail, and whether this be a Limitation to <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>My Lord Chancellor conceived it a good Limitation as a ſpringing Truſt, to ariſe upon a Contingency, and which is not of a remote or long Conſideration.</p>
               <p>As for the Legal Reaſons of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they were theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Many Men have no Eſtates, but what conſiſt in Leaſes for years. Now it would be abſurd to ſay, That he who has no other Eſtate than what conſiſts in Leaſes for years, ſhould be uncapable to provide for the Contingencies of his own Family, though they are directly in his immediate proſpect, he ſhall not make proviſions for Wife and Children upon Marriage.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:33203:129"/>2. It was the Opinion of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> That had it been thus Penned it had been good. If <hi>Thomas</hi> die without Iſſue Male, living <hi>Henry,</hi> ſo that the Earldom deſcend upon <hi>Henry,</hi> then the 200 years limited to him and his Iſſue ſhall ceaſe; but then a new Term of 200 years ſhall ariſe and be limited to the ſame Truſtees, for the benefit of <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail. Now what difference is there, why a man may not raiſe a new ſpringing Truſt upon the ſame Term, as well as a new ſpringing Term upon the ſame Truſt? It is true, in 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. in the time of Lord Chancellor <hi>Rich</hi> all the Judges delivered their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; If a Term of years be deviſed to one, provided if Deviſee die, living <hi>I. S.</hi> then to go to <hi>I. S.</hi> is abſolutely void. But in 19 <hi>Eliz. Dier</hi> fo. 277, 328. it was held by the Judges to be a good Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Executory Remainder.</note> and that was the firſt time that an Executory Remainder of a Term was held to be good. As for <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Bayles</hi> Caſe, the Caſe is truly Reported by <hi>Crook;</hi> A Term of 70 years is deviſed to <hi>Dorothy</hi> for life, then to <hi>William</hi> and his Aſſigns all the reſt of the Term, provided that if <hi>William</hi> die without Iſſue living at the time of his death, then to <hi>Thomas,</hi> which is in effect the preſent Caſe; but there was more in it; <hi>William</hi> had the whole
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33203:129"/>Term to him and his Aſſigns. <hi>Dorothy</hi> was Executrix, and granted the Leaſe to <hi>William:</hi> And the Record goes further, <hi>After the death of</hi> Thomas <hi>without Iſſue, it was to go the Daughter,</hi> which was a plain affectation of a Perpetuity; but however this Caſe is contradicted by other Reſolutions. <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Heath</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, and <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> in this Court, which was this, a long Leaſe is limited and declared thus: To the Father for 60 years, if he lived ſo long, then to the Mother for 60 years if ſhe lived ſo long, then to <hi>John</hi> and his Executors if he ſurvived his Father and Mother, and if he died in their life time, having Iſſue, then to his Iſſue; but if he die without Iſſue, living the Father or Mother, then the Remainder to <hi>Edward</hi> in Tail; <hi>John</hi> died without Iſſue in the life time of the Father and Mother: It was Reſolved by Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman,</hi> aſſiſted by two Judges. That the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Edward</hi> was good: The whole Term had veſted in <hi>John,</hi> if he had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived; yet the Contingency never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo wearing out in the compaſs of two Lives in being, the Remainder over to <hi>Edward</hi> might well be limited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:33203:130"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Where will you ſtop, if not at <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Bayles</hi> Caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Every where, where there is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger of a Perpetuity; but ſo is not this Caſe.</p>
               <p>The Equitable Reaſons were:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was Prudence in the Earl to take care, that when the Honour deſcended upon <hi>Henry,</hi> a little better ſupport ſhould be given to <hi>Charles,</hi> who was the next Man, and trod upon the Heels of the Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was very probable and almoſt morally certain that <hi>Thomas</hi> would die without Iſſue, he being not of a good ſtate of Body or Mind, and while ſuch they were circumſpect that he ſhould not Marry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its an hard thing for a Son to tell his Father, That the proviſion he has made for his younger Brothers is void in Law: But it is much harder for him to tell him ſo in <hi>Chancery,</hi> for there no Conveyance is ever to be ſet aſide, where it can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a reaſonable Conſtruction. The Law doth in many Caſes allow of a future Contingent Eſtate to be Limited, where it will not allow a preſent Remainder to be Limited: A man hath an Eſtate Limited to him his Heirs and Aſſigns (this is a Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple;) but if he die without Iſſue, living <hi>I.S.</hi> or in ſuch a ſhort time to <hi>I. D.</hi> this is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33203:130"/>good. Though it be impoſſible to limit a Remainder of a Fee upon a Fee, yet its not impoſſible to limit a Contingent Fee upon a Fee. <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Brownes</hi> Caſe, If a Leaſe comes to be limited in Tail, the Law allows not a preſent Remainder to be limited thereupon; yet it will allow a future Eſtate ariſing upon a Contingency only, and that to wear out in a ſhort time. The Limitation in <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Caſe is after an expreſs Entail, and yet Adjudged good, becauſe it was a Remainder upon a Contingency that was to happen during two Lives, which was but a ſhort Contingency, and the Law might very well expect the hapning of it: But our Caſe is ſtronger, becauſe it is only during one life.</p>
               <p>It was decreed the Plaintiff ſhould enjoy this Barony for the reſidue of the Term, and the Defendants to make him a Conveyance accordingly, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with the Plaintiff for the Profits received ſince the death of Duke <hi>Thomas,</hi> and which they or any of them might have received without wilful default.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> exhibited a Bill of Review in <hi>Chancery,</hi> to which <hi>Charles Howard</hi> put in a Plea and Demurrer, which was Argued before Lord Keeper <hi>North,</hi> and he Over-ruled the ſaid Plea and Demurrer, and Reverſt the Lord Chancellors Decree.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33203:131"/>But afterwards this Decree was Reverſt in Parliament, and the firſt Decree affirmed in behalf of <hi>Charles Howard.</hi>

               <p>THe matter controverted is touching Coſts,<note place="margin">Coſts.</note> the Plaintiff had a Decree againſt the Defendants Father deceaſed, and that the Plaintiff ſhould have her Coſts of that Suit, and the ſaid Coſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxed, they became part of that Decree, as much as if they had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Decree in certainty.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff inſiſted, That the Cuſtom of that Province is excepted out of the Act of Parliament, and if it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Act, it ought to have the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction on their part, becauſe it was made in favour of them, and not of the Widow and Adminiſtratrix, who before the ſaid Act, uſually went away with the whole Eſtate, unleſs more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances prevented.</p>

               <p>This Caſe being heard by the Lord Keeper <hi>North,</hi> he declared, That the 2000 <hi>l.</hi>

               <p>To which the Defendant pleaded and demurred, inſiſting, the ſame was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on good Grounds and Reaſons, and farther inſiſted, that ſince the ſaid Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and before the Bill of Review, the ſaid <hi>Lamb</hi> had paid the ſaid 1500 <hi>l.</hi> with other money, unto the Defendant <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> in Right of the ſaid <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, who was Adminiſtratrix to <hi>Richard Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleby,</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> the Daughter, and that in conſideration thereof, the ſaid Defendant <hi>Atwood</hi> had made a Settlement equivalent thereto, for a Joynture for his ſaid Wife, and the Iſſue Male of their two Bodies, with a proviſion for Daughters, and that they had a Son then living, and prayed

               <p>Which Plea and Demurrer, was argued before the Lord Chancellor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> which his Lordſhip over ruled, and Ordered the Defendant to anſwer, and he would hear the Cauſe <hi>ab origine,</hi> at which hearing, the Defendant <hi>Atwood</hi> and his Wife inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Plaintiffs demand being only a Remote Remainder in Fee, as Right Heir of the Husband, was not ſo valuable in Intereſt, as for a Court of Equity to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree a purchaſe to be made for the Sale thereof, and to take the money from the Wife and Adminiſtratrix, to make that purchaſe, when ſhe ought to return the ſame as Aſſets, or howſoever 1500 <hi>l.</hi> of the money was her own Portion, and belongs to her by her Election within ſix Months, and though according to the ſtrict Letter of the Articles her Husband <hi>Richard Kettleby,</hi> could not be ſaid to die leaving no Iſſue, becauſe he had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter living at the time of his death, yet the Daughter dying within the ſix Months, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for the Wives Election, in caſe he had died leaving no Iſſue, there was great equity to extend the Conſtruction of that Clauſe of the Articles, ſo far as to give her back her own 1500 <hi>l.</hi> portion.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff inſiſted, That ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders in Fee have been conſidered by this Court, and purchaſes decreed to be
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:33203:191"/>made and limited to ſuch Right Heirs, and that the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in this Caſe, cannot be Aſſets, and in like Caſes had been ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged at Common Law; and in this Caſe the Articles have expreſly provided, that the money ſhould go as the Land ought to have gone, as if a purchaſe had been made therewith; and as for the pretence of the ſaid Defendant <hi>Anns</hi> electing 1500 <hi>l.</hi> her power of electing did never ariſe, nor can her power be enlarged by this Court, beyond the expreſs words of the Articles, nor is there reaſon for it in this caſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Articles provided, that ſhe ſhall have a Dower beſides, and the ſaid <hi>Ann</hi> by virtue of her two Adminiſtrations, hath a great perſonal Eſtate beſides the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in queſtion.</p>
               <p>This Court declared, That the 2000 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:33203:192"/>for purchaſing Lands in poſſeſſion in Fee ſimple, to be ſetled according to the intent of the Articles.</p>
               <p>And as for the Defendants the Truſtees,<note place="margin">Truſtees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnified.</note> in regard they relyed upon the ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Signed and Inrolled for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity, in paying the ſaid 2000 <hi>l.</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Atwood</hi> at his Wife, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnified thereby.</p>

               <p>He denies the ſaid Deed was obtained
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:33203:200"/>by Surpriſe; but that the Duke executed the ſame in the preſence of many Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes, and that the Duke left the Deed and Will in his keeping.</p>
               <p>And as to ſo much of the Bill, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Defendant to give an account of what part of the ſaid Dukes Perſonal Eſtate came to the Defendants Hands, he is Adviſed by the Rules of this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court, that he is not Compellable to Anſwer thereunto, for that it appears by the Plaintiffs Bill, that at the time of the Exhibiting thereof, the Plaintiffs were not intituled to make ſuch demand, or to have ſuch account, it thereby appearing of their own ſhewing, that they have not proved the ſaid Will of 87. but that the ſame was, and ſtill is under Controverſie undetermined in the <hi>Prerogative Court,</hi> whereof, or as to that part of the Bill he demurs.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That it was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Will and Deed, the Defendants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, that it was done ſilently, but the Duke would have it kept Secret, that he might be free from Trouble and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>And they inſiſt, That as to the laſt Will of 85. That the Duke Adviſed with Councel, to know whether a Will made after the Settlement, would avoid or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Settlement, was anſwered, that it
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:33203:200"/>would not, and that <hi>Proviſo</hi> muſt be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, whereupon he was well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that the ſaid Deed ought to be ſupported, and not ſet aſide in Equity, being made upon ſuch Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiffs inſiſt, That the ſaid Deed (if any ſuch) being a Voluntary Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, that the Will of 87. is a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation thereof, in a Court of Equity. So that the great Queſtion was, if the ſaid Deed (it being found to be valid at a Trial at Law) is Revoked by the ſaid laſt Will, according to Equitable Intention or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>This Cauſe having been Debated and Argued ſeveral times by Learned Councel, and afterwards by three Judges, <hi>(viz.)</hi> my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treby,</hi> and Mr. Baron <hi>Powell,</hi> it was agreed by them, that the Deed was a good Deed, well executed, and not Revoked by the Will of 1687.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treby</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſhort was thus:</p>
               <p>In 1675. the Duke made his Will, and declares in reſpect that the Earl of <hi>Bathe</hi> was his Kinſman, and had done many Kindneſſes to him and his Family, the Earl ſhould have the greateſt part of his Eſtate, and gives ſeveral Legacies to one
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:33203:201"/>
                  <hi>Monck;</hi> and then he makes a Deed of Settlement in 1681. tho' the Limitations by the one and the other differ; but it is not made to revoke, but to confirm the Will. Both the Will of 1675. and Deed of 1681. do agree in giving the greateſt part of the Eſtate to the Earl of <hi>Bathe,</hi> but the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Deed makes the diſpute; and then there is a Will of 1687. wherein a larger Eſtate is given to the Dutcheſs and Colonel <hi>Monck, &amp;c.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Honour of <hi>Potheridge</hi> may be eſtabliſhed on the <hi>Moncks.</hi> The Plaintiffs Bill is to eſtabliſh the Will of 1687. and ſet aſide the Deed of 1681. and Will of 1675. And the Deed on the Hearing of the Cauſe was directed to be tried, and a Verdict for the Defendant, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff hath acquieſced under it, and ſo this Deed muſt be taken as a good Deed and Conveyance without any ſuſpicion, for the Right was tried, and the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents tried, and if it were good at Law, whether there be cauſe to ſet it aſide in Equity is the Queſtion?</p>
               <p>He was of Opinion, That the Deed was a good Deed, and ought not to be impeached in this Court.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiffs Arguments againſt the Deed are:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Surprize.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concealment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:33203:201"/>3. That the Will of 1687. is a Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Equity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is a Truſt.</p>
               <p>As to the Surprize: He obſerved, they did not make uſe of the word <hi>Fraud</hi> in gaining the Deed, but that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing put upon the Duke for want of deliberation. He ſaid, he was not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that there was any Surprize on the Duke, for he was not languiſhing at that time under any Sickneſs, but it was done and executed in good Company and after dinner, with great Conſideration both before and at that time. They pretend a want of Circumſtances in the execution, whereas Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> was adviſed with before the Deed ſealed, and preſent at the time of the ſealing: Several other Circumſtances were inſiſted on by the Plaintiffs, but none are ſufficient to ſet aſide the Deed. The Deed of 1681. and the Will of 1675. are not inconſiſtent, tho' they differ in the limitation of the Eſtate: But by both, the greateſt part of the Eſtate is given to the Earl of <hi>Bathe.</hi> Tho' they could not find Inſtructions for drawing the Deed, tho' the Deed was not found to be read, tho' no Counterpart was ſealed; yet none of theſe by any of the Preſidents have either been ſingly or altogether allowed, as Cauſes to ſet aſide a Deed in Equity. He was of Opinion that the Deed doth confirm the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:33203:202"/>Will of 1675. in the ſetling and aſſuring the Eſtate, part on the Dutcheſs and part on the Earl, and as to particular limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Duke might alter his Mind from the Will, and do it according to the Deed.</p>
               <p>The Third thing they inſiſt on by way of Surprize is, That it was done contrary to the Dukes Intention: Whereas the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants have proved, that it was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Intention, and the other ſide ſay not, neither before nor after the making of the Deed: For that there were ſeveral Wills made by Duke <hi>George,</hi> and not a word of any Limitation of any Eſtate to the Earl of <hi>Bathe.</hi> Which is anſwered by the other ſide, That the Wills are in few words, and thereby all given to Duke <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and not any proviſion made for any younger Son or Daughter; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe Wills, nor in the Will of 1675. is there any thing given to the Father of this <hi>Monck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Objection, That the Duke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended any thing to Sir <hi>Walter Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> for that he was fallen into his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and what is given is a remote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; but there were Proofs of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Kindneſs to the Earl of <hi>Bathe.</hi> And the greateſt proof that there was no Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, was the preſence of Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> at the execution of the Deed, who
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:33203:202"/>was of great Ability and Integrity, and would not be guilty of a ſurprizing, and he was ſatisfied that there was nothing but fair dealing in the execution of the Deed.</p>
               <p>As to the Will of 1687. perhaps it might be intended, not to give this Eſtate to the Earl, and that there was great Advice taken on that Will.</p>
               <p>But what was the meaning of the Duke in making the Will of 1687. if it muſt ſignifie nothing?</p>
               <p>The trueſt Anſwer that hath been given is, That he Adviſed whether a Will would revoke the Deed, and when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it would not, but that he had put all out of his power (except by a ſtrict Revocation,) then he gratified the continued Importunities of his near Relations, and endeavours by that to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf eaſy; ſo he conceived the Deed well executed, and is purſuant to the VVill of 1675. and cannot be ſet aſide on the point of Surprize.</p>
               <p>The next point inſiſted on is Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they inſiſt on a Clauſe in the Earls Anſwer, where the Duke ſent for the Deed, in Order to make a new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Will he might have Revoked without the Deed; but as the Plaintiff ſaith, the not doing of it was a Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Argument is good, if the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:33203:203"/>fact were true. But its not ſo, for it doth not appear, that he ever intended to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Deed; and both the Will of 75. and the Deed of 81. were delivered into the Earls Hands, juſt before the Duke went abroad, and the Concealment was not from the Duke, but the Dutcheſs, and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Cited of <hi>Clare</hi> contra <hi>Com' Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Raw</hi> contra <hi>Pott,</hi> come not up to this Caſe.</p>
               <p>The next point inſiſted on is Revocation. The Will of 1687. (ſay the Plaintiffs) is a Revocation in Equity, though there was not the Quality or Number of Witneſſes deſcribed and limited in the <hi>Proviſo.</hi> Its no Revocation, neither was it intended ſo, the Duke wrote a Letter to the Earl, that he had done him no wrong, and he left the Keys with him, and imployed the Earl in ſelling the <hi>Cockpitt</hi> and <hi>Albemarle Houſe,</hi> and the Duke continued in the ſame mind to <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Clargies,</hi> and there ſeemed no reaſon why he ſhould not be of the ſame mind as to the Earl, and there was a great Proviſion made for the Dutcheſs by the Will and Deed, but not a word of Mr. <hi>Monck</hi> in either, but only in this laſt Will. Where there are two voluntary Conveyances, he that hath the Eſtate by Law, ſhall hold it. Where a Party ſhall be relieved, where there is a defect, they ſhall be relieved, where there
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:33203:203"/>is a defect, they ſhall be relieved, where there is a deceipt or falſity, and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are, that they have been relieved in ſuch Caſes, where it is to pay Debts, or to provide for Children, ſeveral Preſidents have been Cited, as <hi>Price</hi> and <hi>Green, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> and <hi>Thannett, Webb</hi> and <hi>Webb,</hi> temp. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Hamilton</hi> contra <hi>Maxwellin,</hi> 1655. <hi>Bowman</hi> and <hi>Yates, Wallis</hi> and <hi>Coate</hi> contra <hi>Gryme, Thwaytes</hi> contra <hi>Deg, Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> contra <hi>Phillpott.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Truſt, nothing was ſaid by him of it, for it cannot be preſumed, that there was any Reſulting Truſt, for that was to undoe what he had done before. The Defendants are in poſſeſſion by a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict upon the Deed, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſturbe them.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> This Caſe depends on a Will of 1675. and a Deed of 1681. and a Will of 1687. and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether the Will of 1687, doth Revoke the Deed of 1681. it being not purſuant to the power: He was of the ſame Opinion with Baron <hi>Powel,</hi> and Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treby.</hi> The Deed is a good Deed, and ſo all the Evidences and Circumſtances relating to the Deed, ought to be taken to be true <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> was adviſed with in the Draught, and was preſent as a Witneſs, and that the Will of 1687. is a good Will; but not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:33203:204"/>againſt the Deed of 1681. which muſt be taken to be a good Deed, and he reduced what he had to ſay to four Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Frame and Manner of the Deed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether on the Evidence, the Deed were unduly obtained.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the Circumſtances and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the Perſon of the Duke himſelf, and the Circumſtances he was in, when he made his Will of 1687. for whether the Plaintiffs ſhall be relieved againſt the Deed, is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, Its ſaid the Will of 75, and the Deed, make but one Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that is fetcht from Law; for at Law, a Fine and Recovery and Deed to Lead the Uſes, are but one Conveyance. So as to the firſt from the Contradictions and Miſrecitals in the Deed, which have been inſiſted on, there is no Cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve againſt the Deed.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, on the matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Deed, he ſaid, he could not find any undue obtaining of the Deed, but that Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> his Hand was in the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of the ſaid Deed, and that the Deed was not executed by a Surpriſe, for the Dukes Councel was preſent at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Deed, and here is no fraud
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:33203:204"/>to ſet it aſide. As to the Caſe of <hi>Winn</hi> and <hi>Bodvile,</hi> which has been Cited, there was a great fraud and practiſe; but there is no fraud or circumvention here, but the Deed is fairly obtained, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a preſumptive Evidence againſt it, which ought not in Equity, to be an Evidence againſt the Deed, ſo as there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no Evidence, that the Earl ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Duke, or that the Duke was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized.</p>
               <p>As to the third point, touching the Circumſtances and Conditions of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Earl was a near Relation, and had done many kindneſſes to the Duke, and his Family, and was eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by him; and though the other Perſons that claim by the Will of 1687. may be of Relation to him, yet he that hath the beſt Title, hath the right. And ſo it is in the Caſe of Perſons, where both claim under two voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances.</p>
               <p>As to the fourth and laſt point, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Circumſtances the Duke was in, when the Will was made, the Duke when he made the Will, was under a Reſtraint by the Deed of 1681. for his power was executed, and the Duke had reſtrained himſelf. And the Court of Equity hath no power to examine into the Reaſons and Conſiderations for doing it, and there may
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33203:205"/>be Reaſons for a Wiſe Man to Reſtrain himſelf, for he may not know what ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize may be put upon him; and as there may be reaſon for it, ſo it ſhall be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there was good reaſon. Further, there is no Evidence of an Intention in the Duke to execute the power, for he had an opportunity to have done it; and becauſe a Man may one way diſpoſe of his Eſtate, that therefore he may do it any way, is ſtrange; and if that may be done, it will overthrow all the Conveyances that are made.</p>
               <p>They on the other ſide pretend, the Duke had forgotten the Deed. It was made but in 1681. and well atteſted by Credible Witneſſes; and if he had forgotten it, his Councel had an Abſtract of the Deed; and becauſe a Man had forgot a Deed, that ought not to be a cauſe in a Court of Equity to ſet that Deed aſide, for Memory may fail, but a Deed is <hi>Permanent,</hi> ſo there ought to be no relief againſt the Earl, and thoſe that claim by the Deed of 1681.</p>
               <p>Lord Keeper: There be three Suits in this Court, the Dutcheſs her firſt Eill is to ſet aſide the Deed of 1681. And the ſecond Bill by the <hi>Moncks</hi> much to the ſame effect, and on the ſame Evidence. And the third Bill by the Earl, complaining of the Will of 1687. On the hearing of the Cauſes the 8th day of <hi>July</hi> 1691. before the then Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:33203:205"/>and on a Trial directed, touching the Validity of the ſaid Deed of 1681. there was a Verdict for the Deed, and this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict hath not been ſtirred. The Cauſe comes now to be heard on the Equity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the whole matter: I declare the Deed doth ſtand Unrevoked at Law, and the Defendant the Earl of <hi>Bathe</hi> is well intituled under that Deed, for here are no Creditors nor Purchaſers, or any Children to be provided for, and the benefit that comes to the Earl, is the <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the <hi>Northern</hi> Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The Court did declare, that there is not any ſufficient matter in Equity appears to ſet aſide the Deed, therefore diſmiſt the Bill of the Earl of <hi>Mountague,</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Monk,</hi> ſo far as they ſeek relief to ſet aſide the ſaid Deed of 1681. and as to the other matters, Equity to be reſerved.</p>
